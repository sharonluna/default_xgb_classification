- `requirements.txt`: Libraries to install
- `data/`: Directory to store input data files for analysis and modeling.
- `test_nb.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the main code for performing EDA and model development.
- `funcs.py`: Python script with helper functions used in `test_nb.ipynb` to optimize analysis and modeling processes.

# Install dependencies:

Install the necessary packages by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Usage
`test_nb.ipynb`: This notebook contains all the steps for data analysis and model development, including:

* Data Loading and Cleaning
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Model Training and Evaluation

`funcs.py`: Contains helper functions used in `test_nb.ipynb` to make the analysis more modular and organized.

## Requirements
* Python >= 3.8, Python < 3.13.0
* Jupyter Notebook
* Required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`
